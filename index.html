        <img id="arto" src="Illustration Fantaisie.jpg" style="float:left ;"  width="500" height="500"  ><p style="font-size: xx-large; color:ghostwhite;">Artorias the Abysswalker was one of Lord Gwyn's Four Knights, known for his unbendable will and skill with a greatsword. He was a legendary warrior who fought the creatures of the Abyss, even traversing it to save the kingdom of Oolacile alongside his wolf companion, Sif. However, he was eventually overwhelmed and corrupted by the Abyss, sacrificing himself to protect a young Sif. His story is often misconstrued, and the player-character ultimately defeats the corrupted Artorias and the Manus, Father of the Abyss, to save Oolacile.

    The Abyss Watchers are one of the five Lords of Cinder in Dark Souls III. They are the leaders of the Undead Legion of Farron, a group of warriors sworn to combat and destroy anything corrupted by the Abyss — a spreading darkness born from humanity’s corruption. The Watchers took inspiration from the legendary knight Artorias the Abysswalker, and their entire existence revolved around continuing his legacy.
